In Props and components we study about 

###### 1> Module export
 which are of 2 types Named export and default export  a demo file is present with name 6_module1.mjs

######## 2> COMPONENTS

 In this we made an component folder in src folder which contain  App js
 Now in this component folder suppose we want to add feature in Navbar so make an (starting capital Letter) "Navbar.js" file in which we type ""{rfc}""

Add this componet in App.js file {" <Navbar></Navbar> "} -> "<Navbar/>"


######### 3> PROPS

These are variable passed in components  which are caught at Navbar.js as (Props)

proptypes are used to put constraints so that we do not send different type of variable then required

a> first type in Navbar.js == > (impt)
b> then apply constraints == > Navbar.propTypes

this help to catch error when we send object in place of string 

####### 4> DEFAULT PROPS

these are used when we do not pass any value but make a variable in NAVBAR.js (props.title)


####### 5> Use of   {"isRequired"} in propTypes
give warning in console  of browser
